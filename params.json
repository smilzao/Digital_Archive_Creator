root_folder : This is the absolute path of DAC folder, root of the software\r\n- Server:\r\n - server : web address on which ocs respond\r\n - conf_file : is the absolute path of dbconfig.inc.php file that is the configuration file of ocs \r\n- Server_Config:\r\n - ip : ip on which web application listen for connection (ip of server or 0.0.0.0)\r\n - port : port on which web application listen for connection (if you have iptables turned on you must add an entry for this port)\r\n - ssl : in this release this field is unused\r\n - ssl_cert_path : if you want ssl you must insert the absolute path of certification in form of file.crt\r\n - ssl_key_path : if you want ssl you must insert the absolute path of key file in form of file.key\r\n- Administrators:\r\n - user : this field contain the username of ocs users that you want promoted administrators of DAC, the form is [\"user1\", \"user2\"]\r\n- PID:\r\n - file : This is the pid file (inside DAC) in which DAC save his state\r\n\r\n<a name=\"cronteab\" />\r\n### Cronetab\r\nThe cronetab component is divided in two parts, one for system's tasks and the other one for application's tasks.\r\nThe System's Tasks are written in system_cron.yaml file and it contains one task to check if website is up and if the site is down it try to start up the site.\r\nI put this task in separate file to put in read only mode because this task is core part of the software and in the next release I want to give the possibility to admin to edit others task in a web way.\r\nThe other file cronetab.yaml contains the system routine jobs like search for new computer and you can edit the frequency modifying its value.\r\nThe syntax for both files is under the cron leaf.\r\n- description: description of task (it is facultative but I encourage you to write in it to maintain better the tasks).\r\n- command : is the python file that you want launch, now there is only one python check to control, if you write some python plugin to extend check you can call it in this field writing the relative path starting from root dac folder.\r\n- schedule: is the cron syntax schedule, in the next release I want to try to implement English natural language syntax support but for now you have to edit in cron syntax way.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"scheda\" />\r\n### Scheda\r\nIn scheda.yaml you can find sections defined in OCS report engine and you can decide which of them you want report in your fancy reports.\r\nYou can enable the view setting the value to 1 and disabled with 0.\r\nIn the next releases I want introduce web editing choise instead of file manually editing and control to normalize file when value differ from 1 or 0.\r\nThe voices are:\r\n- Account\r\n - accountinfo\r\n- Components\r\n - controllers\r\n - drives\r\n - inputs\r\n - memories\r\n - monitors\r\n - networks\r\n - ports\r\n - printers\r\n - slots\r\n - sounds\r\n - storages\r\n- Softwares\r\n -
